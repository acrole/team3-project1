We analyzed the data to see if we can find how the traffic delays related to accidents vary throughout the months, day of the week and propose some explanations for the observed distributions
The graph below shows the variations of traffic delays with the month. We see that the number of traffic delays is progressively lower as we go into the summer months with the lowest number of traffic delays due to accidents on the month of July. The number of delays goes back to high numbers in August, which we interpret as "return to work/classes effect"

The next analysis done with this data (from Texas) was to prove if Fridays are the day of the week when most traffic delays occur. Our intuition and common sensense suggests that on Fridays people are getting paid, want to go back home fast or have some alcohol to celebrate, hence there are more chances for accidents and traffic delays. However, the analysis of the data shows that Friday is not very different in the number of traffic slow-downs due to accidents than other days of the standard work week. However, on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) slow-downs due to accidents are less frequent. One interpretation is that less people are driving and hence traffic is smoother on weekends. Curiously, on Mondays traffic slow-downs due to accidents is lower than any other day of the work week and perhaps this is due to higher degree of awareness and less fatigue at the start of the work week.

In order to see better the details of the differences in the day of the week effect we re-scaled the y axis, as shown below. When we use a different scale in the y axis the difference in number of slow-downs for the weekdays is clearer. Surprisingly, Tuesdays have the highest number of traffic slow downs, but the reasons are not well-understood. Friday comes second in the ranking and this could indicate that our hypothesis is at least partially correct.

Finally, we analyzed the distribution of traffic delays per day of the month in Texas. The variability is not easy to understand. The graph below suggests that most days of the calendar month have similar number of slow-downs due to accidents. Four months of the year have 30 days and seven months have 31 days, February has either 28 or 29 days. It is not very clear that the end of the month, a common payday, has a strong effect on the number of slow-downs due to accidents. The average of slow-downs due to accidents is not greater on a 30th day than any other day of the month, although the average number of slow-downs on the 31st could be (comparatively) greater than any other day of the month if we double the count observed.

Below we give a link to the code that contains the portions of the project related to the table of content #7. This part of the code also contains the reading of the csv file, the conversion of strings to datetime timestamps and the creation of a dataframe with extra columns for each part of the timestamp (year, month, day, hour, minute, second) of the start and end of the traffic slow downs. The timestamps have to be separated to do arithmetic operations and analyses of the distribution of slow downs due to accidents. The month of the year was used to identify in which season a delay in traffic due to an accident occurred, in adddition to other analyses that have been used throughout the project. We used the csv output of the dataframe to share the timestamp fractionation.
