## Texas Weather and Traffic Effects

From 2017 to 2019, there were 248,299 traffic incidents on Texas roads. What role did weather play in those incidents?

## Do the 4 seasons matter in Texas in relation to accidents/incidents?

There is no significant difference in the number of incidents in Texas between each of the seasons. Fall is slightly higher than the rest of the seasons.

Fall is slightly elevated with 64,670 incidents, Winter has 63,184, Spring has 61,900 and Summer has the least with 58,544.

## In what type of weather conditions do we find the most incidents in Texas?

Strangely enough, when it comes to Texas Highways, Clear weather has the most incidents with around 60,000 during the 3 year period.   This 20,000 more
than the next highest cause - Mostly Cloudy.   Cloudiness seems to be a slight factor in the majority of all other incidents.  Any type of cloudiness, seems to 
affect the overall ability to drive in Texas.  It was expected that a heavy rain would be more of a cause of concern but that was not the case.  Light rain caused
more of an issue than the heavier rain.   Ice/Snow were really not a factor due to limited occurrences in the State of Texas. 

##  In the top 10 weather conditions, is time of day a factor?

As we can see from the chart, more accidents happen during the day than they do at night.  Overcast skies had a larger role at night than all other weather conditions
with the exception of clear. 

## What type of delays are caused by these incidents?

Severity shows the severity of the accident in terms of traffic impact. One being the least, four being the most. In the top 10 weather conditions, the majority of the accidents fall into the 2 and 3 severity levels. For the most part, they fall into category 2 meaning that there is a slight delay when an accident occurs.

##  Does visibility play a factor in traffic incidents in Texas?

No, there was no correlation that limited visibility caused any additional effects on whether an incident occurred or not.  The majority of the incidents reported had a 10 mile
visibility supporting this conclusion.  While this data covered traffic delays it did not dive into the true causes of these incidents, leaving one to conclude that Texas drivers
are just bad drivers no matter what the visibility or weather conditions are at the time of the incident.
